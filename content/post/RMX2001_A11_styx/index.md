## About ROM
Styx Project is a distribution that aims to be really minimalistic and beautiful right out of the box. We merge patches from master and other sources to give you the best performance out of your device.
We work on the ROM to make it extremely stable; we believe in the user not facing any issues regarding their device, flash and forget.
The ROM doesn't ship with any sort of bloat, and many hardening patches are in the process of being merged to give you the most secure and bloatfree experience possible.
With AOSP security patches, Linux and CodeAurora tags being merged within hours of its release, you are sure to receive the latest security fixes and updates on your device as soon as possible!
