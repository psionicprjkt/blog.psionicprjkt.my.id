**FlokoROM** v4 is Custom ROM which based on crDroid and LineageOS. we have many convenient features but we are aming "be clean".

### Working features:

- All working except the one mentioned in "Know issues"

### Known issues

- Extra cameras
- Night light flickers
- ViLTE (native video calling)

### Reporting Bugs

- Don't report bugs if you have any custom kernel or module installed
- Grab a logcat right after the problem has occurred. (Please include at least a few pages of the log, not just the last few lines, unless you know what you're doing.)
- If it is a random reboot, grab /proc/last_kmsg. (Do not bother getting a logcat unless you can get it just before the reboot. A logcat after a reboot is useless)
