**Styx Project** A free and open-source aftermarket distribution, based on the Android mobile platform, aiming to give you the cleanest possible alternative and a perfectly stable, smooth and beautiful experience right out of the box.

### Working features:

- all working except the one mentioned in "Know issues"

### Known issues

- Night light flickers
- ViLTE (native video calling)
- Offline charging (KPOC) *but it can still be charged, only the animation doesn't work

### Reporting Bugs

- Don't report bugs if you have any custom kernel or module installed
- Grab a logcat right after the problem has occurred. (Please include at least a few pages of the log, not just the last few lines, unless you know what you're doing.)
- If it is a random reboot, grab /proc/last_kmsg. (Do not bother getting a logcat unless you can get it just before the reboot. A logcat after a reboot is useless)
