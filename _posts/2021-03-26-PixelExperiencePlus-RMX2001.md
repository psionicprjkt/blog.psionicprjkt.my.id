**PixelExperience** is an AOSP based ROM, with Google apps included and all Pixel goodies (launcher, wallpapers, icons, fonts, boot animation). Our mission is to offer the maximum possible stability and security, along with essential and useful features for the proper functioning of the device.

### Working features:

- All working except the one mentioned in "Know issues"

### Known issues

- Extra cameras
- Night light flickers
- ViLTE (native video calling)

### Reporting Bugs

- Don't report bugs if you have any custom kernel or module installed
- Grab a logcat right after the problem has occurred. (Please include at least a few pages of the log, not just the last few lines, unless you know what you're doing.)
- If it is a random reboot, grab /proc/last_kmsg. (Do not bother getting a logcat unless you can get it just before the reboot. A logcat after a reboot is useless)
