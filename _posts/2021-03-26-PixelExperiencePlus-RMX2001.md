### Working features:

- SELinux, RIL (Data,SMS,Calls), VoLTE, Wifi calling, Fingerprint sensor, WiFi, Bluetooth, Camera, Camcorder, Audio, GPS, NFC, Sensors, Video Playback, ZRAM, Internal audio recording, Faceunlock, Signature spoofing, Safetynet without magisk, Offline charging (KPOC), DT2W, EngineerMode

### Known issues

- Extra cameras
- Night light flickers
- ViLTE (native video calling)

### Reporting Bugs

- Don't report bugs if you have any custom kernel or module installed
- Grab a logcat right after the problem has occurred. (Please include at least a few pages of the log, not just the last few lines, unless you know what you're doing.)
- If it is a random reboot, grab /proc/last_kmsg. (Do not bother getting a logcat unless you can get it just before the reboot. A logcat after a reboot is useless)
